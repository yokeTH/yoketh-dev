You’re using **🥞 Crepe**, a ready-to-use editor built on top of Milkdown — great for shipping quickly and customizing later.

If you want this editor in your own app:

\`\`\`go
import (
  _ "YOUR_MODULE/docs"

  "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
  "github.com/yokeTH/gofiber-scalar/scalar/v2"
)
\`\`\`

## Architecture at a glance

> Milkdown is a framework for **building your own Markdown editor**.

A typical setup has three layers:

- [x] 🥛 **Core** — the editor runtime + plugin system.
- [x] 🧇 **Plugins** — features you turn on/off (search, collab, etc.).
- [x] 🍮 **Components** — headless building blocks (slash menu, toolbar).

Learning all three isn’t required to start. **\`@milkdown/crepe\`** gives you a fast on-ramp.

## Scratchpad

> Use this section for today’s notes, standups, or product thoughts.

- Goals: semiconductor / software / aerospace venture ideas
- Running hypotheses:
  - Editor as a component in internal tools
  - Collaborative spec writing with structured export
- Next experiments:
  - Insert custom node for “Design Decision” with metadata
  - Add keyboard-driven slash menu for power users
