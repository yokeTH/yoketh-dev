You‚Äôre using **ü•û Crepe**, a ready-to-use editor built on top of Milkdown ‚Äî great for shipping quickly and customizing later.

If you want this editor in your own app:

\`\`\`go
import (
  _ "YOUR_MODULE/docs"

  "github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
  "github.com/yokeTH/gofiber-scalar/scalar/v2"
)
\`\`\`

## Architecture at a glance

> Milkdown is a framework for **building your own Markdown editor**.

A typical setup has three layers:

- [x] ü•õ **Core** ‚Äî the editor runtime + plugin system.
- [x] üßá **Plugins** ‚Äî features you turn on/off (search, collab, etc.).
- [x] üçÆ **Components** ‚Äî headless building blocks (slash menu, toolbar).

Learning all three isn‚Äôt required to start. **\`@milkdown/crepe\`** gives you a fast on-ramp.
